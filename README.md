# Code-Optimization
This project consists of analyzing and optimizing the performance of a given code which aims to apply transformations to uncompressed raw video content (RGB) stored in a file. We will analyze and improve the performance of the codes provided by documenting and justifying the steps followed (successful or not). To do this, we will respect a rigorous experimental protocol so as not to leave room for inexplicable instabilities.

This project is part of the scientific and technological training at ISTY.
We will have to analyze and improve the performance of the codes provided by documenting and
justifying the steps followed.
First, we will study the environment in which the treatments will be carried out,
in particular the architecture and the portability of the compiler (on the codes) that we are going to use.
Then we will make the necessary settings in order to have the most precise calculations.
A second phase will be the analysis and measurement of the performance of our code. In this part
we will study, measure, interpret but also compare the metrics or results obtained with
our different versions of code optimization.
Then we will use another compiler and compilation flags and test them on our
different versions of optimizations had previously and compare the results and see if the code has
been optimized or not.
Then we will end with a brief summary of the work done, we will highlight the major
lines and finally we will end with a conclusion which will be a summary of this project, our impressions.
